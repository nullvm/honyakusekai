When I woke up that morning, my phone was flooded with missed calls.

Like I care, you idiots.

Ignoring every single one of them, I leisurely hopped into the shower. Breakfast was, of course, instant ramen. Toss in some bagged veggies and sausages — they keep well, and it tricks me into thinking I’m getting some kind of nutrition.

I cracked open the door to the toilet — or rather, the gateway to the grassy plains — just to check if everything was still as it should be, then returned to my room and booted up the PC.

If I was going to keep hunting slimes, I might as well make it easier on myself. And while I was at it, I figured I’d stock up a bit for peace of mind.

So then... how should I go about it?

The easiest upgrade would be my weapon. Kicking or stabbing with a kitchen knife worked, but a spear would make things way more convenient. As for picking up the coins... rubber gloves? A sticky stick? I once heard powerful magnets might work, but I had no idea where to buy one.

Hmm… none of those sounded ideal.

People fish as a hobby, but do professional fishermen cast rods? No. They use nets and traps to haul things in — unless you're talking about some rich guy cosplaying as a fisherman.

If I wanted maximum efficiency, then setting traps to wipe out the slimes in one go was the way to go. To gather 100 yen coins, it'd be best to lure them to a single spot.

In other words, bait them in, then wipe them out.

If it worked, I could sit back and watch the money roll in. One sweep, one pile of coins.

Maybe something like those bug zappers that attract flies with bait and zap them with electricity... just line them up out in the open and place a collection box underneath. No idea what slimes would eat, but I could probably order all the parts online.

Yeah. That’d work. Probably.

Such brilliant schemes filled my mind — which I promptly decided to put off until “some other time.”

I spent a chill morning, then headed back out to the plains.

"Sei!!"

Yep. Kicking them still felt the best.

I checked the time as I got to work — one hour of effort could net me about 8,000 yen. I stuffed the coins into my everyday backpack and once it was full, I'd return to my room and dump it into a delivery box I’d repurposed as a vault.

You’d think all that kicking and gathering would tire me out, but my body felt amazing. I could probably do a thousand squats without breaking a sweat.

I had no idea how much I’d gathered already. Probably close to 50,000 yen if I included yesterday’s haul.

I absentmindedly kicked a slime, waited for the familiar pop, and bent down to pick up the—

“…Huh? This one’s big.”

Wait, this wasn’t a coin. It was a jewel!

Whaaaat!? A rare drop!? Or maybe a reward for a kill milestone!?

A light blue gem, about the size of a pachinko ball, shimmering softly — almost like a slime crystallized.

Could I sell it? What if I got it appraised and it turned out to be cursed or something?

As I stood there pondering its value, it sank into my palm and vanished.

“Hah!?”

And then—

A surge of knowledge blitzed through my brain. Memories I never had, knowledge I never studied. Forced into my mind, etched into my nerves.

Countless "Skills" beyond all logic. And the existence of “Skill Orbs” that engraved them into the body and soul.

When I calmed down, I realized exactly what had happened.

The skill I obtained was Purification.

Incredible. That means... I never have to clean again.

Euphoric, I ran back to my room and cast Purification on my futon.

It vanished completely.

◇◆◇◆◇

I lost all motivation and decided to call it a day.

As I reviewed the information forced into my head, it seemed Purification had to be used with careful intent — otherwise, it’d obliterate all unclean things indiscriminately.

Glad I didn’t cast it on myself by accident.

Where does the stuff even go when it gets erased? Is someone else using my futon in another dimension?

…Well, it served me long enough.

I didn’t have a spare futon. I didn’t own anything fancy like a sofa either. What’s gone is gone. No use complaining — might as well order a new one.

I opened up my favorite online store and started browsing futons. Up till now, I’d always gone for the cheapest, flattest ones. But maybe this time I’d treat myself — a king-sized futon to roll around in? Or even a full-blown bed?

I had the money now!

After some totally justifiable fantasies, I bought the cheapest futon again. I also added a piggy bank to my cart.

No way was I going to keep buying things with huge piles of 100 yen coins or lug around a bag full of change like a maniac. I’d make it look like I was just exchanging full piggy banks — totally normal, totally innocent.

It’d probably arrive tomorrow. When it did, I’d open the can with a cutter, stuff it full of coins, and take it to the bank.

Perfect plan. Flawless.

I ate another bowl of ramen and passed out for the night.
