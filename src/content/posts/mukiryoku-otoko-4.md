I was in the middle of a really nice dream when I got shaken awake.

“Senpai! Quitting out of nowhere is just cruel, you know! Last night was a nightmare!”

It was Takanashi — my junior at work. Small, energetic, and stacked in all the right ways. Still no clue what someone like her was doing at a place like that.

“I had to work through the whole night, you know? Before you give me some lame excuse, at least let me crawl under the covers too.”

She wriggled her way into my futon. Hey—don’t lift it up, it’s cold, damn it.

“Hehe… senpai, you’re so warm.”

…was a fantasy I cooked up in my head to comfort my lonely, overworked brain. Even this thin, stained futon was starting to feel nostalgic.

I was feeling good this morning, so I decided to go get some beef bowl.

Sure, eating inside the restaurant would get me free cold tea, but being around strangers made my skin crawl. I’m a proud lone-wolf cheese beef bowl otaku.

Tossed out the trash, mounted my bicycle… then suddenly missed my toilet.

Which was worse — walking into the convenience store while holding a beef bowl bag, or smelling like beef bowl while asking to use the bathroom?

Today too, I had so many deep things to ponder.

After eating, I got back to kicking slimes. The monotony was getting to me, so I decided to spice it up with a personal time attack challenge.

Alright! Let’s go! 9800 yen! Just a little more! You can do it! Don’t give up now! WHY WOULD YOU QUIT THERE!?

Ding-dong!

“Ah, yes! Coming!”

Panting lightly, sweat beading on my brow, I opened the door to receive a delivery. Must’ve been awkward for the courier — dude probably didn’t want to see my huffing face again. Hope he gets reassigned.

Inside the box: a futon and the piggy bank.

I opened up the futon first and let it fluff up. Cheap ones are vacuum-packed and always have that weird smell. Can’t be helped.

The piggy bank was one of those “save up to a million yen with 500 yen coins” kind. With 100 yen coins, I’d top out at about 250,000 yen.

Cracked it open with a can opener and poured in the coins I’d collected. Only filled it halfway. Bought five of these things, so I figured — might as well go exchange some.

I threw the half-filled can straight into my bike’s basket and headed to the bank.

At the counter, they counted it all up — 132,800 yen. And then whacked me with a 1,650 yen handling fee. Bro, that’s three days’ worth of food! What a ripoff.

Well, whatever. I knew I could’ve exchanged it in smaller amounts for free, but that would've drawn more attention. This money’s gonna be my “waste fund” for a while. I’ll treat myself to some decent meals or buy some dumb stuff guilt-free.

Maybe grab some sushi on the way home?

That idea was quickly derailed — my bike was gone.

No. Freaking. Way.

I instinctively turned my head away — and spotted my bike a kilometer ahead, being pedaled away.

That’s MY bike!

I bolted.

The sidewalk was too slow, so I jumped into the street and sprinted after the thief.

The bike wasn’t going fast — I caught up in 30 seconds, ran up from behind, and dropkicked the bastard right off the saddle.

“You damn moron! That’s MY bike!”

Bike retrieved. Victory secured. Though now the seat and handlebars were warm and gross.

Back home, I laid out the freshly puffed futon and flopped onto it.

It was the cheapest model, sure — barely wider than my shoulders — but damn, nothing beats the feel of brand-new bedding.

I thought about heading back out to hunt more slimes, but then remembered it was more efficient to hunt red slimes in the evening. So instead, I turned on the PC and watched some videos.

A VTuber was talking about their recent eating habits. Apparently, they almost never go out anymore and rely solely on food delivery.

I’d never tried it myself. Always figured it was a waste of money. But maybe it’s time I embraced the modern age? Get decent meals and save time?

I checked it out.

A Big Mac set — 1,680 yen with delivery fee.

…Interest gone.

Welp, guess it’s ramen again.

Evening came, and I hit the fields to hunt red slimes.

Yeah, definitely more efficient. My mood was high, my pace fast — I raked in over 20,000 yen in just one hour.

My body was in peak form. My wallet was getting fatter.

And yet, here I was — still standing in a field, looking at my toilet door.

The world stretched out endlessly, vibrant and beautiful…

…And yet I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was chained to something invisible.

With that thought lingering in my chest, I lost my motivation again, turned on a VTuber stream, and drifted off to sleep.
