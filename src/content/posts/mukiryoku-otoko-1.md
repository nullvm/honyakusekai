"Morita. You’re heading out at ten tonight to hit three family restaurants. Be here by nine to load up."

"Yeah, got it."

"Then go home already."

9 a.m.
My night shift as a building maintenance guy had ended. I’d go home, sleep, and wake up just in time for work again. It had been three months since I last had a real day off. Technically, since I had the afternoon free, today counted as a “holiday.”

They worked me to the bone for dirt pay. Not that I had anything better to do. The idea of quitting or job-hunting sounded like a chore.

It was a thirty-minute ride back to my apartment. I threw a pack of instant noodles, a bag of pre-cut veggies, and some sausages into a pot. Done.

I turned on my PC, watched some random videos while eating. After that, it was sleep, a shower, and repeat. Groceries were all online. I had no hobbies. No friends.

Morita Satoru. Age 32.

Today was just like any other—empty, tiresome, and painfully ordinary.

I didn’t think of myself as unhappy. Not happy, either. It’s not that I had no interests. It was just... everything felt like too much effort.

Better go to the bathroom before I sleep. Waking up because I need to pee would be annoying.

I didn’t really need to go. But I went anyway.

"...Huh?"

Before me stretched a vast grassland.

"What... is this?"

Behind me was a tiny hallway, just two steps long—the same as always. One step back and I’d be in my apartment again. But beyond the bathroom door, where a filthy toilet should’ve been, lay a clear blue sky and fields of green.

This was the kind of wild twist you'd only see in manga. Something that should’ve happened to a hopeful teen or someone with a bit more motivation in life.

Yet even I couldn’t help but feel a flicker of curiosity.

It had been years since I walked on grass. I couldn’t remember the last time I really looked up at the sky. A breeze passed over me, and something long forgotten stirred in my chest.

I wanted to walk—just a little. Through this beautiful world.

But was it safe? I glanced around. Off to the left, something round was bouncing along the grass.

Clear... like water? It moved on its own?

Only one thing came to mind: a slime. The weakest enemy in every RPG, the very first stepping stone.

I wasn’t actually thinking, “Oh, cool, slimes are real now!” But in a situation this bizarre, logic had already packed its bags and left.

...Guess I’ll try dealing with it.

Without overthinking it, I walked up and gave it a good kick.

But—!

“Geh—ugh!!”

The thing bounced right back, slamming into my stomach. It hurt more than I expected.

"You little shit—!"

Sure, I attacked first. But now, we were enemies. There was no room for reason anymore.

I grabbed the kitchen knife by the sink and stabbed the damned bouncing jelly.

Splurt.
One thrust and the slime popped like a busted balloon, oozing out some mystery gunk before collapsing into silence.

"Tch... That was dumb. Now the knife’s gonna get dull."

I didn’t understand any of this, but it was clear this place wasn’t safe. I figured I’d offer the land some nutrients and then head back.

Pop!

A pleasant sound rang out. It came from the slime. Or, rather, the place where it used to be.

Lying there was—

"A hundred-yen coin?"

A strange world.
A slime-like creature.
Cash dropping when it dies.

Just a single coin. But it was real money. And with that, my brain jumped ten steps ahead.

"Hey, Morita here. Yeah, I, uh… gotta head back to my folks. So I’m quitting. Later."

I hung up mid-reply. A half-hearted lie was enough.
