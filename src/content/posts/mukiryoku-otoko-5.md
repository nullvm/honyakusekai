It was a morning wrapped in the embrace of a brand-new futon.

I had a dream about going to work, and woke up actually thinking I had to head out. Then it hit me—I don’t work anymore.

Was it depressing? Hell no. I relived the misery of having a job, then basked in the sweet joy of not needing one. From the moment I opened my eyes, I got a free shot of happiness. Being jobless really is the best.

I popped open the fridge and downed some ice-cold water.

Lately, my appetite’s been ramping up like crazy. Must be all that exercise I’ve been doing.

Refilled the empty bottle with that delicious tap water, purified it, and tossed it back into the fridge.

I’d been faking it with two-pack ramen meals, but enough was enough. Time to eat like a human being.

But eating out means taking a shower, shaving, and putting on real clothes... ugh, screw that. Delivery it is.

So I hit up the online grocery. If I order in the morning, it arrives by evening. There’s no way I’m blowing money on overpriced takeout.

On top of my usual stuff, I threw in a 200-yen pizza, extra cheese, steamed buns, corn dogs, frozen takoyaki, Big Katsu snacks, and even some Black Thunder bars.

Fuhahaha! Behold true luxury! Tonight is going to be amazing.

Even my morning ramen tasted better than usual. A heart full of hope really changes things.

After eating, I headed out to the grasslands.

But today was different—I brought my bike.

I figured I’d ride a little farther than usual. A tiny adventure. Doesn’t matter if there’s nothing out there. I’m free, and I’ll live however I please.

Hopped on and pedaled out.

...Only to realize, grass is absolute hell to ride on. Gave up, parked the bike back at the usual spot, and continued on foot.

I walked for twenty minutes or so, glancing back every few steps to make sure I wasn’t getting lost.

The landscape barely changed until I reached a patch where the grass gave way to bare earth—a little bald hill I’d spotted from afar.

There, stumbling around like drunks, were little dirt golems.

They barely came up to my knees, aimless and wobbly like slimes. No real threat, just a bunch of animated clods.

“Sei.”

I gave one a kick. Its torso and one arm crumbled off.

“Ow! Owowow!”

Cheeky bastard smacked me with its remaining arm. That actually stung! Gonna leave a bruise, damn it!

I kicked the rest of its body away, but it still squirmed creepily.

Unnerved, I stomped the pieces out of instinct. Felt something hard crack under my foot—and the golem finally collapsed.

Huh. That must’ve been the core. I guess these things are “golems,” huh?

Ten seconds after falling apart, the golem let out a little pop, then transformed.

Nice, maybe 500 yen this time? Could even be 1000—thing put up a bit of a fight.

But what popped out… was a ball.

Not a skill orb. Just a lump of dirt.

A freaking mud dumpling.

Annoyed, I smashed it against the ground. It broke apart into worthless soil.

My motivation vanished. I went home.

It wasn’t even noon yet, but there was no need to rush anything.

The groceries would arrive by evening. Until then, I’d kill time with videos and message boards.

I let a Vtuber stream play in the background—she was happily gaming away—while I opened up a few threads.

Kansai Expo thread, huh. Clicked on it.

It was full of hardcore homoerotic posts. Goddamn it.

How about the home cooking thread?

Seemed promising at first, but then people started talking about peeing into electric kettles. Straight-up hell.

Seriously, are these guys even from the same world as Vtuber girls? It’s like they’re a different species.

I closed the boards and went back to browsing videos.

“Oh, I’ve seen this girl around lately.”

Without thinking, I clicked.

That was my mistake.

The video showed her flirting in a sugary voice with a male Vtuber.

W-Wait, but she’s always with that other girl from the same agency, isn’t she? They’re besties, always streaming together, and, and—

I quietly closed the video.

Then I ran. Back to the other side of the toilet door. To the grasslands.

What took me twenty minutes earlier now took under a minute.

I reached the bald hill and crushed the golems without a thought.

I didn’t care about mud dumplings.

No one was at fault. I wasn’t mad. That girl was doing her best. Nothing was wrong.

I was just sad.

I just… wanted to believe there was still a beautiful place in this world.

Eventually, the heat in my chest cooled down.

When I looked around, the golems were gone.

I suddenly remembered my groceries were coming, and hurried back home.
