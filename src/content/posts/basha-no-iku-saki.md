"Lady Feline, you must be very tired. When you return to the house, I will prepare a cup of tea with your favorite apples. When you get back to the house, I'll make you a cup of tea with your favorite apples."

"Thank you, Amalia. But may I sit here for a little while longer?" My heart is beating fast from the suddenness of it all. Once it calms down, I think I can walk to the carriage.

Feline was sitting in a hard chair in the school's spare room, staring blankly out.

Her fiancé, Duchess Vessel Herzelzetto, had just called off their engagement.

Vessel, who had summoned Feline, was waiting for her with Baroness Susanna Bayer.

"I have decided to break off my engagement to Feline," Vessel said. "Unlike you, I want to walk the rest of my life with Susanna, who is cheerful and lovely. With Feline, it is a loveless engagement by royal decree to join hands between duchesses of different factions. I will make every effort to have my Dukes of Hazelzet and your Dukes of Clarsen join hands in some other way, so I hope you will understand."

Vessel seemed intoxicated by his own words, and Feline swallowed too many sighs to get the words out properly.

Finally, she said, 'Yes, sir. I guess I'll leave the rest to my father," and Vessel nodded silently.

Susanna next to him gives Feline a wicked smile.

I felt sorry that Vessel was in a state where he could only see what he wanted to see, so much so that he missed these faces.

As they left the spare room, Amalia, who had been waiting outside the room, entered immediately on her own.

Amalia, a classmate and Feline's maid of honor, is the daughter of a cousin of Feline's father, the Duke of Clarsen, and has been living with the Duke of Clarsen's family and serving at Feline's side during her time at the school.

After whispering, “Excuse me,” to Feline, who was staring blankly out the window, Amalia sat down on a seat near the entrance.

There was enough trust and friendship between Feline and Amalia to allow this.

After telling Feline that the engagement was over, Vessel left the spare room and walked with Susanna down a deserted corridor.

'.... Feline didn't even move, let alone cry, did she?'

'I think she might be crying now, out of frustration.'

'Let's go back and take a look.'

Vessel was not fond of the always composed Feline.

The Dukes of Clarsen, with their first prince, were in favor of the second prince, while the Dukes of Hazelzet were in favor of the first prince.

Vessel's father is working to gather the nobles of his faction to place the second prince, born of the king's favored side-chamber, on the throne of the Dauphin.

The side chamberlain was from the ducal family of the Duke of Hazelzet.

The king, however, had no intention of making the second prince the crown prince, and the Dukes of Hazelzet were itching to make a move behind the scenes, when the king offered them a marriage proposal with the Dukes of Clarsen.

The king was not pleased to see the two dukes at odds with each other, and he was the first to announce on the spot that the royal family intended to crown the first prince, who was the oldest child born to the queen.

The engagement was made by royal decree, with the dukes of Clarsen and Hazelzet joining hands to support the first prince.

Vessel was not happy with his engagement, which had been arranged outside of his will.

He felt that his life was as light as a piece on a board.

Then he met and fell in love with Susanna, an honest and lovely woman who was nothing like his fiancée, Feline, and Vessel's heart was filled with joy and excitement.

It seems that Feline is still in the spare room, and I can hear her talking inside.

Vessel listened closely, wondering if she was crying to Amalia, a classmate who was always with her.

“...... will those two be happy?”

"It's impossible. They won't last a month."

“One month......”

"Love is like soup freshly poured from the pot, isn't it? The hot soup that Mr. Vessel and the Baroness were tasting was delicious because of the spice that was me. The immorality of betraying your fiancée, the triumph of stealing the duchess's fiancée, the soup sprinkled with such spices is just hot water from today onwards, now that they are gone."

“Just hot water?”

The duchess was not the only one who was not happy about it.

The fact that Vessel had been so foolish was blocking her heart.

Even though their engagement was made in defiance of the king's order, Feline believed that they would come closer to each other as they got to know each other's personalities little by little.

She had hoped that they would be able to build a peaceful relationship by moving toward each other and cuddling.

However, this was painted black when they first sat down facing each other after their engagement was finalized.

I could see the hostility in Vessel's eyes.

I'm going to beat him someday, and it won't get me any closer if I'm the only one who steps up to the plate against someone who thinks so.

Still, I was always thinking, 'What should I do from here, and what can I do?'

I would ask him if he would like to have tea with me or lunch with me, but he would always be unapproachable.

When I approached his friends, they would look at me with a mixture of pity and annoyance and say, 'We can't help you.'

Vessel was like a precipice on a precipice, sadly unable to find anything that would give him a foothold.

Feline gave up on him when such a Vessel someday began to stand by the baroness and did not even try to hide it.

"Yes, it's just hot water, Amalia. The soup of love that those two thought was true would soon cool down and become just hot water with no taste without my presence."

And even the ‘just hot water’ will not be able to keep it.

The soup that you taste with someone else to spice it up always ends up being one thing.

---

Vessel, who was in the hallway, breathlessly picking up Feline's voice, was shocked as if he had been hit over the head with the words, 'If the spice called Feline disappears from the soup between us, it's just hot water.

Indeed, his heart is no longer as excited these days as it was the first time he and Susanna smiled at each other in the dark to escape Feline's eyes.

Is it possible that the guilt I felt toward my father for this engagement and not Feline, the immorality that I shouldn't be doing this, were just making the time with Susanna feel like something special ......?

But Vessel strongly reminds himself that it is never just that.

---

Their soup never gets cold nor loses its flavor.

That was just a sore loser's word that Feline threw around with her silly pride.

The ‘cheerful and lovely Susannah’ that Vessel-sama mentioned can only exist if I am compared to her. I wonder how long the charm of being ‘cheerful and lovely’ will retain its value in this aristocratic society if there is nothing to compare it to.

Yes, it is often the case that when looked at in isolation, there is not much to be said.

The baroness can continue to compare herself to me, who should have disappeared from Master Vessel's mind. I wonder if the Duke and Duchess of Herzelzetto will look warmly at the Baroness who pushed me out of that chair."

Even from Amalia, the daughter of a countess, Baroness Susanna Bayer gives the impression of being an unapproachable aristocratic daughter.

What does Susannah intend to do when she rubs elbows with the heir apparent of the ducal family who has a fiancée?

Amalia sensed that the daughters and sons of the Duke of Herzelzetto's family, as well as other unrelated daughters and sons, were looking at her with puzzled eyes.

The puzzled eyes were naturally directed at Vessel as well, but he didn't seem to notice.

'You can compare me, the daughter of a duke, to a baroness, can't you?　No matter how hard you try, you will feel the eyes of the unfortunate ones. When I appealed to Master Vessel about it, he said, 'But you're the one who sent Feline away and wanted to be next to me, aren't you?　You have no choice but to do what she was able to do. A baroness trying to pass herself off as a duchess is not going to get anywhere because she has lived in a different environment. The baroness feels that Lady Vessel is cold and that it wasn't supposed to be like this. It is only when she realizes that a man who has a fiancée and whispers his love elsewhere before dissolving it is neither sincere nor kind that she realizes that she can't take it back.

If you have found someone else to love, it is only faithful to break off the engagement first, clean yourself up, and move on.

But, well, they're both the same. There are only two kinds of men in this world: those who never whisper their love to anyone but their fiancé, and those who can whisper their love to anyone but their fiancé, and those who are dishonest. Even if the person you choose is the latter, you are always only responsible for your choice. Besides, there are only two kinds of women in this world: those who never approach a man with a fiancée, and those who approach a man with a fiancée and say that they will steal him away with their charm. Both are on the dishonest side, so it's not right to complain about someone who is similar or the same. Well, that baroness is strong enough to tell me, without Master Vessel's presence, ‘You couldn't buy love with a knighthood, my sympathies,’ so I can swallow Master Vessel's disloyalty."

---

Susanna's mind went blank when she heard Feline's story.

Vessel, who had chosen her, was dishonest and cold ......?

Tonight, Vessel was going to introduce Susanna to the Duke and Duchess of Hazelzetto.

I told Vessel that I didn't have the right dress to meet the Duke and Duchess, but he told me that I could just be you as usual.

Susanna was a little disappointed when Vessel told her that once the engagement was official, he would make her a wonderful dress from the Duke and Duchess of Hazelzetto's official dressmaker.

As Feline said, the Duke and Duchess of Hazelzetto would compare Susanna to Feline, which convinced her like water falling from a high place to a low place.

I wonder if the daughter that a legitimate son is trying to get by cutting off a royal engagement is really suitable for a duchess. ......

I can see a future where no matter what they do, they will be told, 'This is why baronesses do what they do.

No matter where you compare them, there is no point where Susanna is superior to Feline, who seems to have perfected everything.

I heard that Feline had also completed her education to become a future duchess.

How many years would it take Susanna, who has mediocre grades and doesn't particularly like studying, to get the education that it took the brilliant Feline one year after her engagement?

And all the while, she would be compared to that perfect Feline. ......

Above all, Susanna could no longer believe that Vessel would have kind words for her when she was depressed by it, after hearing Feline's story.

---

“Is something wrong, Miss Feline?”

'No, it's ....... I said something about their love and being compared, but then I realized that it may not be on that level anymore. It's ...... a little painful.

I'm not sure what to do about it, but I'm not sure I'm ready for it. Do you think they will break up sooner?

I reminded myself that a month might mean ...... two lives. If you leave here and go back to the Duchess of Herzelzetto, hell will be waiting for you. When Master Vessel's father finds out that his illegitimate son has broken off his engagement to the Duchesse de Clarsen without his permission, he will beat him up in a fit of rage. But that is only the beginning of the end. ...... The fact that he disrespected the king's life is a big deal, but His Highness the Duke of Herzelzetto is the one who has been supporting His Highness the Second Prince, you know?　I wonder what His Highness the Second Prince will do when he hears that the heir apparent of such a ducal family has disrespected the king's life. He may think that the day when he can outwit the First Prince is far off because of it.

'Yes, I have overheard that His Highness the Second Prince is a caustic man. ......

In any case, the Dukes of Herzelzet will not get away with it. The Duchess of Hazelzet will not get away with it. It is possible that His Majesty will not issue a letter, but that His Highness the Second Prince will make it disappear in secret. I thought that a month might be enough for the life of Lord Vessel, but something might happen sooner. ......And ......My engagement to Lord Vessel has triggered several other engagements between the First and Second Princes' houses. I wonder what will happen to them. I wonder what will happen to them. ......If we are forced to break off the engagement, Master Vessel will bear the resentment of those with whom he already has a good relationship. ......"

---

Vessel almost shouted.

Because of his own broken engagement, the Dukes of Herselzet would disappear......?

He wanted to deny that such a ridiculous thing was possible, but the fact that this engagement was by royal decree had never crossed his mind until this moment.

I was just not amused that I was being treated like a pawn, and I thought that my betrothed, Feline, was also a part of it.

If His Majesty hears that he has treated the king's life lightly, what will happen to His Highness the Second Prince, whom my father is promoting,.......

What if His Highness the Second Prince's anger is directed at the Duchess of Hazelzetto for having wronged him? ......

What would happen if I asked Feline to withdraw the engagement?

The word “broken engagement” is still locked up in this spare room.

It would be a good idea to retrieve and withdraw it before it oozes outside.

When I think about it, Susanna's presence is no longer beginning to fade away.

It can't be helped, since the very existence of the Duchess of Hazelzetto is at stake.

As I was about to put my hand on the door, I heard Feline say something that made me doubt my ears.

'Hey Amalia, if I'm not mistaken, the escort knight who was outside the door with you kicked down the hallway and disappeared the moment Master Vessel said, ‘I've decided to break off the engagement,’ right?

'Yes, sir. He only said, ‘Take care of the rest,’ and left at an unbelievable speed while trying not to make a sound with his shoes. He probably pulled his horse out of the carriage that was picking up Lady Feline and ran toward the Duchess of Claassen's house. By now, the Duke's ears must have heard that the engagement has been broken."

Feline's guards were also always near Feline as students.

As one would expect, he could not use his belt in the school, but he easily knocked his opponent's back to the floor with his physical skills.

The person who was knocked down in training was said to have seen the sky with the impact before he even had a chance to think about it.

Well, I guess it's time for me to go home.

'Yes, sir. The escort that came back with the replacement horses should be here by now.

He did a good job. Your father will reward him, but I would like to give him something as well.

Oh, the guards have arrived at the door on the other side. Please follow me, Mademoiselle Feline.

'You're leaving here already, ....... Oh yes, of course I have a reward in mind for Amalia. How about buying matching ribbons at the Bonnefeldt Trading Company?

I'm sure Feline just wanted to buy some ribbons. Come on, let's get out of here.

Feline stood up and placed a small circle of Feline's own feelings for Vessel on the desk.

The second prince might take the failure of the ducal heir with a generous heart.

Vessel may not inherit the Dukedom of Hazelzet, but he may be welcomed as a son-in-law by the Barony of Beyerl.

Or he may become a commoner, and there is still a future left in which he may be able to keep his love alive.

When I talked to my father about this, all he said was that there would be all kinds of possibilities.

When I asked my father what he himself planned to do, he gave me only vague answers.

There was sadness in Feline's heart, but no hatred.

It's just that Vessel, who was never a foolish person by nature, has learned that love is an emotion that makes it impossible to think about things in this order.

What a terrible thing love is. ......

Is it something you can control?

The first thing that she did was to look at the “love” feeling.

But she considers it a good thing that she was able to experience the horror of it before she knew what it felt like.

She put a small ball of something on the desk a few minutes ago, but she wanted to break it so that it wouldn't breathe the air here and accidentally turn into love! He slammed the desk with a "Pang!

This is the end.

Good-bye, Mr. Vessel.

And then Feline followed Amalia's back and went out into the bright light.

When Feline walked out this door, Vessel was going to rub his forehead on the floor, apologize, and rescind the engagement.

But inside the spare room went silent for the last time with a dry, panning sound.

That sound echoed strangely in Vessel's head and replayed over and over.

Scratching his head didn't make that sound go away.

---

On the day I had invited Susanna to the restaurant house “Lavin Pavilion” on the outskirts of King's Landing for the first time, I was about to leave the school when I was unusually approached by Feline.

She said, 'Mr. Vessel, there is something I really need to talk to you about. I have nothing to say to you,' she said, 'I have a reservation at Lavin-tei, and I can't keep Susanna waiting.

Feline glanced at him with a look of despair, and Vessel, feeling somewhat satisfied, headed for the Lavin Pavilion with light steps.

The Lavin Pavilion is a small inn that serves meals and is visited by painters who stay there for months at a time and lovers who hide from the world and leave after three hours.

I had a sweet time with Susanna for the first time that day, and now I am beginning to think that Feline knew where she was going and everything about Susanna.

I think Feline was trying to stop me that day from walking into a folly from which there is no return. ......

If I had talked to Feline that day, or maybe this wouldn't have happened: .......

Vessel was finally coming to accept that it was too late for anything else.

Susanna also understood that hell awaited her when she returned to Baron Beyer's house.

They both reached out and embraced each other.

The embrace was not the sweet embrace of two lovers, but more like the embrace of two strangers who are only trying to keep warm in a frozen cave.

The soup of true love was no longer frozen rather than becoming 'just hot water.

Slogging out, Vessel and Susanna arrive at an opulent carriage bearing the coat of arms of the Duchesse de Hazelzetto.

The coachman raises his hand, brightly and out of place.

Welcome back, Vessel boy. It is a personal matter, but just before I left the mansion, I received word that my wife, who gave birth in the morning, has safely given birth to a baby girl, and I have come this far as if I were flying through the air. Oh, I am sorry to tell you this ...... story, I was just so happy ......"

......, no, congratulations on the safe birth of your baby.


I'm sure you'll be very happy to hear that.

The Aurigami were smiling, their faces crumpled up, unable to hide their joy.

For the first time, he knew that the birth of a baby was something that made the father look so happy.

Vessel must now return home to his father and see the angry, twisted face of the father who might once have smiled like this.

Or will he see a face of sorrow at his son's foolishness?

'Yes, you can take this and go back to your own house as you are today. It's a celebration. Don't worry, I'm going back in the other carriage."

With these words, Vessel took off the diamond-embedded watch and handed it to Auriga.

It was a watch given to him by his father some time ago.

The baby had a dazzling future ahead of him, and he felt as if his heart were about to be crushed by something, so he involuntarily grabbed at the breast of his shirt.

Listen, don't go back to the Duke of Herzelzetto's today. Someone will pick up the carriage later. You can exchange the watch for money and buy something for your wife and baby. Please, take good care of your wife ......."

'I cannot accept such an expensive item!　Vessel-boy!

Vessel pushed Auriga's shoulder a little harder as he tried to push him back.

Just hurry up and go back to your house," he said!　Get the carriage to your wife and baby, quickly!

He climbed into the coachman's seat as if being driven by Vessel, and the coachman turned around several times and started the carriage.

Vessel barely swallowed his tears as the auror looked like he was about to cry.

'...... Susanna, how do the baron's carriages always do?

'If it's twenty minutes past pick-up time, the carriage is supposed to leave empty. I often had ...... someone drop me off, so ...... I'm probably back already today."

Then we'll pick up a street coach."

Yes, Mr. Vessel.

Once we get to the Duchess of Hazelzetto, we'll go to ...... and then to .......

I'll go anywhere with Master Vessel. I'm glad you had a baby, that Aurigurian you were talking about.

'......Oh, yes,...... baby is good, it holds the future in its hands,......Susanna, I'm sorry. I'm ...... sorry, I've beaten all kinds of people to the ...... depths of misery. ......"

'It's not only Mr. Vessel's fault. I drank the soup that spiced that one up, along with myself."

Susanna's face looked as if it had been drained of many things.

Her face looked like a white cloth that had been hung up by the maid and was about to be taken in, all the dirt and dampness gone.



What I could not get out of my mind was Feline's smile.

I had once been moved by her smile, but somehow I had taken it as if I had lost something, and with that stupidity I had shattered my own future.

Not only my own future, but also the past efforts and future glory of every person involved in the Duchesse de Hazelzetto family .......

Not even the time to atone for that too great crime will be given to Vessel.





The street carriage stopped in place, and Vessel and his friends got in.

Slowly, the horse made its way through the steps.

Vessel muttered softly in his mouth that he wished the carriage would run toward yesterday.









The End
