This site was created by a developer known as [nullvm](https://github.com/nullvm)—a personal project born out of curiosity, passion for language, and the desire to learn by doing. Like many developers, he wanted a space where ideas could be built in public, and in this case, the idea was simple: turn language learning into a living, evolving process.

As someone actively learning Japanese, nullvm realized that traditional methods—apps, flashcards, and isolated grammar drills—weren’t enough. What was missing was context. That’s where translation comes in. Translation forces you to engage deeply with content: it makes you slow down, notice structure, and truly think in both languages. So this site was built as a space to make learning Japanese more immersive and more meaningful—by translating real content and sharing the process.

But this isn’t meant to be a solo journey.

Anyone who’s interested is more than welcome to join. Whether you’re learning Japanese, another language, or just interested in the process of translation and community-driven learning, there’s room for you here. Contributions are open, feedback is welcome, and the goal is to grow together.

This site is built on the belief that learning is better when it's shared, and that translating—especially as a learning method—is a powerful way to uncover how language really works. Every sentence you translate teaches you something new about meaning, nuance, and communication.

In short, this is a hobby project with heart: a small, open corner of the web for anyone who wants to learn by doing—and do it alongside others.
