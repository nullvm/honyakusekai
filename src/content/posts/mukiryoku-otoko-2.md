I Defeated a Slime and Got 100 Yen. Truly, a Glorious Victory.

The 100 yen I earned from defeating a slime was an incredible accomplishment. I mean, it was so amazing that, caught up in the moment, I actually quit my job. And honestly? That felt pretty damn great.

After picking up the coin, I looked around. Slimes were still bouncing all over the place. Holding the shiny 100 yen in my hand, I stared at it intently, a strange excitement bubbling up inside me.

“How long was that? Ten seconds from stab to coin drop?”

Move, strike, wait for the coin to appear, and pick it up. If I can beat one slime per minute, that’s 6,000 yen an hour.

Compare that to my job—an hour getting ready, another commuting, then eleven hours of grinding through night shifts just to walk away with a monthly take-home of 210,000 yen.

Meanwhile, slime hunting? Only 35 hours for the same payout. That’s just three days of work! No taxes. No social insurance. It’s perfect!

…Well, maybe I was getting ahead of myself. I’ve only beaten one so far. I need to calm down and go after the next one.

“C’mon, I don’t need luxury. If I can stay home and earn 180,000 yen a month, that’s plenty. Heck, if I can make five grand while still collecting welfare? That’s the dream.”

Whispering my miserly calculations, I crept up to the next slime and struck it preemptively—stab!

Sure enough, it popped in a single hit. As I watched—

Pop!

“There it is! Another one!”

A sparkling 100 yen coin lay before me.

I couldn’t remember the last time I got this into something.

Fueled by the visible reward of each 100 yen and dreams of a laid-back future, I hunted slimes with mindless dedication.

Never once did I feel lost. I just kept going until I had exactly 100 coins.

Seeing the endless supply of slimes gave me peace of mind. I returned to my room. I hadn’t even worn shoes, so I dirtied the hallway a bit—but eh, I’ll clean it later.

From the grassland, my house’s entrance looked bizarre: just a lone door standing in empty space. Small. Eerie.

Back in my room, I shoved the 100 yen coins into my pocket and stepped out again. Time to test if these coins actually worked. This whole thing’s been pure fantasy so far, but some part of me wanted to be sure.

I didn’t want to risk handing the money to a human, so I headed for a vending machine instead. I dropped a coin into the 100 yen machine I always used, and—

Beep!

The product buttons lit up. It worked.

“I won! This is victory! Total victory!”

I’m a goddamn winner now! Wahahaha!

I bought a coffee and drank it. Knowing it was purchased with magic slime money somehow made it taste even better.

Fully satisfied, I borrowed the bathroom at a convenience store, bought some fried chicken I didn’t even want, and headed home.

As soon as I settled in, I got super sleepy. Right, I’d worked all night yesterday. I crawled into my messy futon, popped a piece of karaage into my mouth, and passed out.

“Zzz...”

When I woke up, it was evening. I felt fantastic. My body, which was always heavy and foggy with fatigue, now felt like it did when I was a kid—light and refreshed.

First thing’s first: check the toilet portal. If it’s gone back to normal, I’ll seriously cry.

“Please… please still be there…”

I opened the door, hoping for that familiar grassland—and there it was. A crimson-tinted sky over a sea of green.

Alright. Still connected. Seems like time flows naturally there too. That’s a relief.

This time I brought shoes and stepped out onto the grass.

The slimes were bouncing again, now glowing the same reddish hue as the sunset. They're low to the ground, so stabbing them with a short knife’s kind of awkward.

Maybe I’ll try kicking one this time. Feels like I could pull it off. My body just feels… different now.

I gave myself a light running start and launched a soccer-style kick straight at a slime.

“Take this!”

Pop!

“Yesss! Got it!”

The slime exploded cleanly.

Man, I really am in good shape. Even crouching and stretching feels easy. My shoulders are loose, and I can touch my back with ease. I jumped experimentally and leapt higher than I expected, landing flat on my butt.

I'm getting stronger as I collect coins. No doubt about it—this is leveling up. What else could it be? With all the fantasy crap going on, questioning it just seems pointless.

Don’t think—feel.

Making money and getting healthier? This is the best deal ever. Let’s rack up even more.

Another slime popped. As I reached for the coin… wait, there were two 100 yen coins.

Huh? Why? A glitch? Bonus round?

I scooped up the 200 yen and looked for my next target. They still look like the usual… wait, no. That one’s red.

I thought it was the sky reflecting off it, but no—this slime’s definitely red.

“Hup!”

Pop!

Defeated it, waited a moment… and yep. Two coins again. 200 yen.

Evening slimes are red and drop 200 yen. So what about night?

“…Night might be dangerous, so maybe I’ll just chill today.”

Dinner was pasta boiled and mixed with mayo and mentsuyu. I watched a Vtuber being loud and cheerful, then drifted off to sleep.

I originally wanted to hop on the Vtuber trend and write something about them... but I gave up.

Special thanks to the rookie Vtuber I studied: Mitsukawa Kerisu, the demon with donkey legs and heir to the Ononokeris clan.
