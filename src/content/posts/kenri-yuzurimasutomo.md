Dear Father

I am so glad to see the lovely camellia flowers blooming in the courtyard where I like to spend my time. My schoolwork is going well, and I have been awarded first place for this term! I am sure it will only go downhill from here on out! I am happy that father is proud of me, even if only a little. The other day, I went to water the flower beds that I am in charge of, and I was curious to see where the flowers had been planted. 

And then, oh my! There were precious koedenaknar seeds planted there! I earnestly conveyed to the teacher that I would by all means like them to hand it over to me, but I was unfortunately refused. What a pity. It is true that koedenaknar is highly toxic, and if accidentally ingested can cause loss of voice, and the antidote may or may not be effective. ...... I'm not going to try to infuse it or mix it into a candy. It was the first time I had seen it in the flesh and I should have observed it more carefully.

Father, have you ever see the seeds of the koedenaknar? I was told that grandfather discovered and named it: ...........................(I'll leave it to your imagination. ) .............................That is why .....,

From Alain, the third son of the Duke of Randyll, "I love it! Political affairs!" I have proposed to him to be my husband. I would like to ask you again to propose our engagement to the Duke of Randyll.

P.S.

When the teachers asked me about koedenaknar, I replied that "your father is currently the leading authority on the subject", so I think a messenger from the school will be on his way. Please respond to them.


From Florence

---

“......, what the hell...”

"How can I help you, Sir? You have a letter from Miss Florence, I presume?"

The young deputy, who happened to be visiting the mansion to make a report, asked fearfully, seeing Laos' agitation for the first time.

"It's a big deal."

"Something has happened to the Lady Florence.

"I may have to retire five years early."

"Pardon me ......?"

“Florence, I hear he has captured a very respectable young man with a strange love of politics.”

When the steward was shown the letter from Laos, he smiled and said, “That's wonderful news.,” but the young deputy was puzzled.

"...... is this a place to rejoice? He says he likes government affairs...not Miss Florence, but government affairs?"

"It will be all right. Florence has a clear idea of what she likes and dislikes about people. If she didn't like them, she wouldn't propose herself."

“But...isn't it possible that she doesn't respect Miss Florence as an individual?”

"That doesn't seem likely, though."

“...Why is that?”

"The dukes of Randyll have three sons at present, and the eldest is the heir. The duke of Randyll has three sons and the eldest son is the heir to the duke's throne. His Royal Highness the Dauphin and the eldest son are close in age, and in terms of ability, they will be the next in line after the current duke."

"I see..."

"Then there is a lot of work to be done, even if the internal affairs of the dukedom are left to his wife. In other words, there is no way to get around to the fiefdom. There may be good deputies, but the general thought is to let those of the bloodline take over. The Dukes of Randyll have an extra title and a fiefdom that they can pass on to their two sons. If he really just wanted to do political work, he could support his eldest son or take over the ducal estate. There is no need for them to come all the way to a remote area to be sons-in-law to a lower-ranked viscount's family. In other words, there is a good chance that he liked something about Florence."

“I see...but that would mean ...... no.”

"Well, it seems she is quite the late bloomer. I wonder, is 'wimp' what they call that these days?"

"Whatever it is, if Florence is satisfied with it, I have no objection. I must send word immediately to the Dukes of Randyll to ask about the engagement and to schedule a visit."

Laos rang the bell twice.

Laos rang the bell twice, “You wanted to see me, sir?”

"Gabriel, send word that Florence's engagement proposal and the dates of the visit should be delivered by fast horseback. Then contact the tailor and tell him to bring me a fine, ready-made dress that can be embroidered and altered, since a custom-made dress will not be ready in time. Oh, and contact Roeg's lawyer. We need to finalize the paperwork for the transfer of the knighthood and the rights that come with it."

"Yes, sir."

"Oscar, once the engagement and marriage contract is finalized, please go ahead and pay a visit to the Dukes of Randyll. They have always preferred to have the contractual relations go through the family order."

"Yes, sir."

Until the day of the visit to the Duchess of Randyll, Lao worked energetically. The servants' reaction to this was,

"What's the matter with our Master? Is the world ending tomorrow?"

"Oh, the replacement is just around the corner. ......"

The newer servants and the longer servants were neatly divided into two groups.

"...... What's with this contract? Are you actually trying to trick my family with a clever trap?"

Rubbing his temples with his fingers, Gilgio said in a tired voice.

"The duchess of Randyll is the head of the dukedom of Randyll. My master is not interested in the title so much as he is in bringing down another family. This is not a trap."

"It would be even worse..."

One thing is clear: the entire power and wealth of the House of Alysdor is yours.

The Duchess Alain Randyll, son-in-law of the Duke of Alysdale, is to receive all the powers and property of the House of Alysdale.

The future heir to the House of Alysdor shall be of the blood of the second son of the blood of the second.

To summarize, the entire House of Alysdor is given to Lord Alain. In summary, "The entire Alisdor family will be given to Lord Alan, and everyone who is currently a member of the Viscount Alisdor family will be reduced to a commoner (except Florence), so don't worry."

"Perhaps Miss Florence will agree with me on this one."

"...... are you sure about that? You've served the family for generations.

"I've been in the service of the family for many generations."

"What do you mean?"

“It doesn't matter what you say to the Master now that he's got retire fever.”

"Don't bother with ......".

"I'm very flattered, sir."

The contract documents, which can only be thought of as a recommendation to take over the family, were to be discussed again at a later date after the date and time for the change of the current Viscount Alisdair's head of the family had been decided.

"......... there's no way we're going to pass this contract. ......"

"The contract is not only for the work, but also for the client's own personal use. I'm not sure how it could happen when the rest of the work is perfectly normal. ......"

"I'm not sure how it happened. I'm going to give the initiative to Alan and only do what I need to do as acting lord."

“...... Alan can take the lead?”

"He's your son. Trust him."

"You're dealing with the Alisdair family."

“Good luck with that.”

There was or was not a melancholy Majesty and Duke.
