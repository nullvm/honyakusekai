## 📚 About the Project

At **Honyaku Sekai**, we believe the best way to master a language is by actively using it—and what better way than through translation?

Our platform turns authentic content like **short stories**, **web novels**, and other texts into interactive learning experiences. As you translate, you’ll build:

- 🧠 Vocabulary  
- 📐 Grammar understanding  
- 🌏 Cultural insights  

### Learn by doing—**translate to learn**.
